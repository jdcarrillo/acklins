<td valign=top><code>SEVERE WARNING: An

assertion has failed, please use devclasses todetermine the source

of this serious bug. Message =</code>
 _____.
<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>An internal assertion

in the jConnect driver has failed.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Use the devclasses debug classes

to determine the reason for this messageand report the problem to

Sybase Technical Support.

<td valign=top><code>Attempt to set database

at login failed. Error message:______.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>jConnect cannot connect

to the database specified in the connection URL.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Be sure the database name in

the URL is correct. Also, if connecting to Adaptive Server Anywhere,

use the SERVICENAME connection property to specify the database.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>010DP
</td>
<td valign=top><code>Duplicate

connection property _____ ignored.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>A connection property

is defined twice. It may be defined twice in the driver connection

properties list with different capitalization, for example "password" and "PASSWORD." Connection

property names are not case-sensitive, and therefore jConnect does not

distinguish between property names with the same name but different

capitalization.
<br><br>
The connection property may also be defined both in the connection

properties list, and in the URL. In this case, the property value

in the connection property list takes precedence.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Make sure your application

defines the connection property only once. However, you may want

you application to take advantage of the precedence of connection

properties defined in the property list over those defined in the

URL. In this case, you can safely ignore this warning.

your request to use the high-availability feature. Please reconfigure

your database, or do not request a high-availability session</code>
.
<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>The server to which jConnect

attempted an HA-enabled connection did not allow the connection.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Reconfigure the server to support

high availability failover or do not set REQUEST_HA_SESSION

to true.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>010HD

<td valign=top><code>Sybase high-availability

failover is not supported by this type of database server.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> The database to which

jConnect attempted a connection does not support high availability

failover.

<strong>Description:</strong> You provided a String

greater than  30 characters for the HOSTNAME connection property,

or the host machine on which the jConnect application is running

has a name longer than 30 bytes in length.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> No action is necessary, since

this is just a warning to indicate that jConnect is truncating the

name to 30 bytes. However, if you wish to avoid this warning, you

should set the HOSTNAME to a String less than or equal to 30 bytes

in length.

accessor information was not found on this database. Please install

the required tables as mentioned in the jConnect documentation.

Error encountered while attempting to retrieve metadata information: _____</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>The server may not have

the necessary stored procedures for returning metadata information.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Make sure that stored procedures

for providing metadata are installed on the server. See "Installing

Stored Procedures" in Chapter 3 of the <i>jConnect

for JDBC Installation Guide</i>.

output parameter was received and ignored.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>The query you executed

returned an output parameter but the application result-processing

code did not fetch it so it was ignored.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> If your application needs the

output parameter data, you must rewrite the application so it can

get it. This may require using a <b>CallableStatement</b> to

execute the query, and adding calls to <b>registerOutputParameter()</b> and <b>getXXX()</b>. You

can also prevent jConnect from returning this warning, and possibly

get a performance improvement, by setting the DISABLE_UNPROCESSED_PARAM_WARNINGS

connection property to true.

<td valign=top><code>One or more jars

specified in the PRELOAD_JARS connection property could

not be loaded.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> This happens when using

the <b>DynamicClassLoader</b> with the PRELOAD_JARS connection

property set to a comma-delimited list of JAR names. When the <b>DynamicClassLoader</b> opens

its connection to the server from which the classes are to be loaded,

it attempts to "preload" all the JAR files mentioned

in this connection property. If one or more of the JAR names specified

does not exist on the server, the above error message results.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Verify that every JAR file

mentioned in your application's PRELOAD_JARS connection

property exists and is accessible on the server.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>010PO
</td>
<td valign=top><code>Property LITERAL_PARAM

has been reset to "false" because DYNAMIC_PREPARE was set

to "true".</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> If you wish to use precompiled

dynamic statements, then you must allow for parameters to be sent

to those statements (if the statements take parameters). Setting LITERAL_PARAMS

to true forces all parameters to be sent as literal values in the

SQL that you send to the server. Therefore, you cannot set both

properties to true.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> To avoid this warning, do not

set LITERAL_PARAMS to true when you wish to use dynamic

SQL. See <A HREF="prjdbcp22.htm">"Performance tuning for prepared statements in dynamic SQL"</A> for

more information.

concurrency combination for the ResultSet that is not supported.

The requested values had to be converted. See <A HREF="prjdbcp10.htm#X15542">"Using cursors

with result sets"</A> for more information

about what ResultSet types and concurrencies are available in jConnect

accessor information was not found on this database. Please install

the required tables as mentioned in the jConnect documentation.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>The metadata information

is not configured on the server.
<br><br>
<strong>Action: </strong>If your application requires

metadata, install the stored procedures for returning metadata that

come with jConnect (see "Installing Stored Procedures" in

Chapter 3 of the <i>jConnect for JDBC Installation Guide</i>).

If you do not need metadata, set the USE_METADATA property

to false.

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>Your application attempted

an operation that the database you are connected to does not support.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> You may need to upgrade your

database or make sure that the latest version of metadata information

is installed on it.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>010SL
</td>
<td valign=top><code>Out-of-date metadata

accessor information was found on this database. Ask your database

administrator to load the latest scripts.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>The metadata information

on the server is old and needs to be updated.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Install the stored procedures

for returning metadata that come with jConnect (see "Installing

Stored Procedures" in Chapter 3 of the<i> jConnect

for JDBC Installation Guide</i>).
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>010SM
</td>
<td valign=top><code>This database does

not support the initial proposed set of capabilities, retrying.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>Adaptive Server Enterprise

versions 11.9.2 and lower had a bug that caused them to reject logins

from clients that requested capabilities that the servers did not

have. This warning indicates that jConnect has detected this condition

and is retrying the connection using the greatest number of capabilities

that the server can accept. When jConnect encounters this bug, it attempts

to connect to the server twice.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Clients can safely ignore this

warning, but if they wish to eliminate the warning and ensure that

jConnect makes only one connection attempt, they can set the ELIMINATE_010SM connection

property to <i>true</i>. Please note that this property

should not be set to <i>true</i> when connecting to

Adaptive Server versions 12.0 and later.

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>Permission to write to

a file specified in the PROTOCOL_CAPTURE connection property

is denied because of a security violation in the VM. This can occur

if an applet attempts to write to the specified file.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> If you are attempting to write

to the file from an applet, make sure that the applet has access

to the target file system.

<strong>Description: </strong>The CONNECTION_FAILOVER

connection property is set to true, and jConnect was unable to connect

to one of the database servers in the list of servers to which to

connect. Therefore, jConnect will now try to connect to the next

server in the list.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> No action is required, as long

as jConnect is able to connect to another database server. However,

you should determine why jConnect was unable to connect to the particular

server that caused the connection warning to be issued.

<td valign=top><code>The

connection's initial character set,_____,

could not be converted by the server. The server's proposed

character set,_____,

will be used, with conversions performed by jConnect.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>The server cannot use

the character set initially requested by jConnect, and has responded

with a different character set. jConnect accepts the change, and

will perform the necessary character-set conversions.
<br><br>
The message is strictly informational and has no further consequences.

<td valign=top><code>jConnect could not

determine the server's default character set. This is likely

because of a metadata problem. Please install the required tables

as mentioned in the jConnect documentation. The connection is defaulting

to the ascii_7 character set, which can handle only characters

in the range from 0x00 through 0x7F.</code>

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>jConnect could not determine

the server's default character set. When this occurs, the

only characters that are guaranteed to translate properly are the

first 127 ASCII characters. Therefore, jConnect will revert to 7-bit

ASCII in this case. The message is strictly informational and has

no further consequences.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Install the stored procedures

for returning metadata that comes with jConnect (see "Installing

Stored Procedures" in Chapter 3 of the <i>jConnect

for JDBC Installation Guide</i>).

<ul>
<li class=fi>The name was entered

incorrectly in the URL.
</li>
<li class=ds>USE_METADATA is true (the default condition),

but the stored procedures for returning metadata have not been installed.

As a result, jConnect tried to execute the <b>use</b> <i>database </i>command

with the database in the URL, but the command failed. This may be

because you attempted to access an Adaptive Anywhere database. SQL

Anywhere databases do not support the <b>use</b> <i>database </i>command.

</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong> Make sure the database name

in the URL is correct. Make sure that the stored procedures for

returning metadata are installed on the server (see "Installing

Stored Procedures" in Chapter 3 of the <i>jConnect

<br><br>
<strong>Description: </strong>An unexpected I/O

error was detected from a lower layer. When such I/O exceptions

are caught, they are rethrown as SQL exceptions using the ERR_IO_EXCEPTION JZ006

sqlstate. These errors are often the result of network communication

problems. If the I/O exception causes the database connection

to be closed, jConnect will chain a JZ0C1 exception to the JZ006.

Client applications can look for the JZ0C1 exception in the chain

to see if the connection is still usable.

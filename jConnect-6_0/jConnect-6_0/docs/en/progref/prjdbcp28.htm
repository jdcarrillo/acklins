<A NAME="X38435"></A><h1>About Web server gateways</h1>
<p>If your database server runs on a different host than your

Web server, or if you are developing Internet applications that

must connect to a secure database server through a firewall, you

need a gateway to act as a proxy, providing a path to the database

server.</p>
<p>To connect to servers using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

protocol, jConnect provides a Java servlet that you can install

on any Web server that supports the <b>javax.servlet</b> interfaces.

This servlet enables jConnect to support encryption using the Web

server as the gateway.</p>
<p><IMG SRC="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note">&nbsp;&nbsp; jConnect includes support for SSL on the client system.

For information on jConnect's client-side support of SSL,

see <A HREF="prjdbcp8.htm">"Implementing custom socket

plug-ins"</A>.</P>
<A NAME="TI96"></A><h2>TDS tunnelling</h2>
<p>jConnect uses TDS to communicate with database servers. HTTP-tunnelled

TDS is useful for forwarding requests. Requests from a client to a

back-end server that go through the gateway contain TDS in the body

of the request. The request header indicates the length of the TDS

included in the request packet.</p>
<p>TDS is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas HTTP is not.

To support security features such as encryption for Internet applications,

jConnect uses a TDS-tunnelling servlet to maintain a logical connection

across HTTP requests. The servlet generates a session ID during

the initial login request, and the session ID is included in the

header of every subsequent request. Using session IDs lets you identify

active sessions, and even resume a session as long as the servlet

has an open connection using that specific session ID.</p>
<p>The logical connection provided by the TDS-tunnelling servlet

enables jConnect to support encrypted communication between two

systems--for example, a jConnect client with the CONNECT_PROTOCOL

connection property set to "https" connecting

to a Web server running the TDS-tunnelling servlet.</p>
<A NAME="TI97"></A><h2>jConnect

and gateway configuration</h2>
<p>There are several options for setting up your Web servers

and Adaptive Servers. Four common configurations are described below.

These examples show where to install the jConnect driver and when

to use a gateway with the TDS-tunnelling servlet.</p>
<A NAME="TI98"></A><h3>Web server and Adaptive Server on one host</h3>
<p>In this two-tier configuration, the Web server and Adaptive

Server are both installed on the same host. 
<ul>
<li class=fi>Install jConnect on the Web server host.
</li>
<li class=ds>No gateway required.
<A NAME="TI99"></A><p><b>Figure 6-1: Web server and Adaptive Server on one host</b></caption>
<br><IMG SRC="images/onehst16.gif">


</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI100"></A><h3>Dedicated JDBC Web server and Adaptive Server on

one host</h3>
<p>With this configuration, you have a separate host for your

main Web server. A second host is shared by a Web server specifically

for Adaptive Server access and the Adaptive Server. Links from the

main server direct requests requiring SQL access to the dedicated

Web server. 
<ul>
<li class=fi>Install jConnect

on the second (Adaptive Server) host.
</li>
<li class=ds>No gateway required.
<A NAME="TI101"></A><p><b>Figure 6-2: Dedicated JDBC Web server and Adaptive Server on

one host</b></caption>
<br><IMG SRC="images/sephost17.gif">


</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI102"></A><h3>Web server and Adaptive Server on separate hosts</h3>
<p>In this three-tier configuration, the Adaptive Server is on

a separate host from the Web server. jConnect requires a gateway

to act as a proxy to the Adaptive Server. 
<ul>
<li class=fi>Install jConnect on the Web server host.
</li>
<li class=ds>Requires a TDS-tunnelling servlet or a different

gateway.
<A NAME="TI103"></A><p><b>Figure 6-3: Web server and Adaptive server on separate hosts</b></caption>

</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI104"></A><h3>Connecting to a server through a firewall</h3>
<p>To connect to a server protected by a firewall, you must use

a Web server with the TDS-tunnelling servlet to support transmission

of database request responses over the Internet. 
<ul>
<li class=fi>Install jConnect on the Web server host.
</li>
<li class=ds>Requires a Web server that supports the <b>javax.servlet</b> interfaces.

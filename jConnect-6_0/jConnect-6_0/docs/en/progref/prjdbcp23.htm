<A NAME="X17366"></A><h1>Cursor  performance</h1>
<p>When

you use the <b>Statement.setCursorName( )</b> method

or the <b>setFetchSize( ) </b>method in the <b>SybCursorResultSet</b> class,

jConnect creates a cursor in the database. Other methods cause jConnect

to open, fetch, and update a cursor.</p>
<p>Versions of jConnect earlier than 4.0 can create and manipulate

cursors only by sending SQL statements with explicit cursor commands

to the database for parsing and compilation.</p>
<p>jConnect version 4.0 and later create and manipulate cursors

either by sending SQL statements to the database or by encoding

cursor commands as tokens within the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) communication

protocol. Cursors of the first type are "language cursors;" cursors

of the second type are "protocol cursors."</p>
<p>Protocol cursors provide better performance than language

cursors. In addition, not all databases support language cursors.

For example, Adaptive Server Anywhere databases do not support language

cursors.</p>
<p>In jConnect, the default condition is for all cursors to be

protocol cursors. However, the LANGUAGE_CURSOR connection

property gives you the option of having cursors created and manipulated

through language commands in the database.</p>
<A NAME="CHDEFCAI"></A><h2>LANGUAGE_CURSOR  connection property</h2>
<p>LANGUAGE_CURSOR

is a Boolean-valued connection property in jConnect that allows

you to determine whether cursors are created as protocol cursors

or language cursors: 
<ul>
<li class=fi>If

LANGUAGE_CURSOR is set to false, all cursors created during

a session are protocol cursors, which provide better performance.

jConnect creates and manipulates the cursors by sending cursor commands

as tokens in the TDS protocol.
<br><br>
By default, LANGUAGE_CURSOR is set to false.
</li>
<li class=ds>If LANGUAGE_CURSOR is set to true, all

cursors created during a session are language cursors. jConnect

creates and manipulates the cursors by sending SQL statements to

the database for parsing and compilation.
<br><br>
There is no known advantage to setting LANGUAGE_CURSOR

to true, but the option is provided in case an application displays

unexpected behavior when LANGUAGE_CURSOR is false.

</li>
</ul>

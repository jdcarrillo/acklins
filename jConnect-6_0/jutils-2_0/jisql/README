Thanks for trying jisql.

To install and start the application pease follow these instructions:
- Add jisql.jar to your CLASSPATH
- Add swingall.jar to your CLASSPATH
- Start jisql by using the scriptfile jisql for Unix or jisql.bat for Windows 
  platforms. (Note: Windows user: You'll need at least a 1024x768 Resolution)

Usage:
	jisql [-d] [-v] [-L metal|system] [-U username] [-P password]
	      [-Z <language>] [-C <LoginInformationFile>]
              [-S host:port[?propname=value[&propname=value]...]] 
	      or 
	      [-S JDBC URL[?propname=value[&propname=value]...]]
 	      or
	      [-S JNDI URL[?propname=value[&propname=value]...]]
	
The default Look & Feel is set to 'metal' and a Connection window will pop up 
where you can enter the needed parameters.

After a successful login the parameters (excluding the password) will be stored
in a property file. The next time you log in you only have to add the 
password. The property file is named <username>.prp in the current directory.
It always contains the data from the last successful connection.

You can also start jisql using these command line parameters:
-L Either 'metal' or 'system' to invoke the Look&Feel of your choice with 
'metal' being JavaSoft's new Look and Feel and 'system' either Motif, Windows
or MacIntosh Look and Feel depending on the system you are running on.
-U Username you would like to use to connect to the database
-P Password appropriate to the username
-d to switch on debug mode
-v to see the version
-Z to set the Language of the Labels in jisql. Currently supported values are
   'English' and 'Deutsch' (or the Sybase aquivalent values 'us_english' and 
   'german')
-C This is the path/filename of file where login information are stored.
   If this value is specified the connection window will be filled with those
   information. If the filename is not provided, -C lets jisql create a file
   name '<username>.prp' in teh current directory.
-S Hostname:Portnumber?Poperties where 
a) Hostname is the name of the machine the database server is running on
b) Portnumber where the database server is listening on
c) Connection properties as described in the jConnect Manuals. 
   If you want to specify more than one property, please connect 
   them using the '&' character; no blanks, please.
   Don't forget to put the string in quotes when you use ? and & characters.
   In a DOS Box you need to mask & with a \

or
-S JDBC URL, the complete JDBC URL
or
-S JNDI URL
   You can specify the JNDI connection string here. In this case don't 
   forget to specify the appropriate properties. For information on JNDI,
   please see jConnect's Programmer's Reference.

If -S is specified -U has to be specified, too. 

Examples:
jisql                                  sets the Look & Feel to metal and opens
                                       the connection window

jisql -L system                        sets the Look & Feel to motif on Solaris
                                       or windows on Windows, and opens
                                       the connection window

jisql -L system -S serv:3312 -U sa -P pass  
				       sets the Look & Feel to motif on Solaris
                                       or windows on Windows, and opens
                                       a connection to host 'serv'

jisql -S serv:3312 -U sa               sets the Look & Feel to metal and opens
                                       a connection to host 'serv'. 
				       User sa, empty password

jisql -U sa -P pass -S "serv:3312?HOSTNAME=brillig&PACKETSIZE=4096"
				       sets the Look & Feel to metal and opens
                                       a connection to host 'serv' setting the 
				       properties HOSTNAME and PACKETSIZE

jisql -U sa -P pass -S jdbc:sybase:Tds:serv:3312
				       uses the complete URL to connect

jisql -U sa -P pass -S "jdbc:sybase:jndi:ldap://LDAP_hostname:LDAP_port/servername,o=MyCompany,c=US?INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdatCtxFactory&PROVIDER_URL=ldap://LDAP_hostname:LDAP_port"
				       uses Sun's LDAP factory to provide a
				       JNDI Connection.
